# 4. Consider the following two sets, A and B, represen ng scores of two teams in mul ple 
# matches.  A = {34, 56, 78, 90}  and B = {78, 45, 90, 23} 
# WAP to perform the following opera ons using set func ons: 
# i. Find the unique scores achieved by both teams (union of sets). 
# ii. Iden fy the scores that are common to both teams (intersec on of sets). 
# iii. Find the scores that are exclusive to each team (symmetric difference). 
# iv. Check if the scores of team A are a subset of team B, and if team B's scores are 
# a superset of team A. 
# v. Remove a specific score ùëã (input by the user) from set A if it exists. If not, print 
# a message saying it is not present.
